/**
* Student's t-test for the equality of means
*
* This test analyzes whether the expected value of a random variable matches a
* certain known value. When there is significant statistical "evidence"
* against this hypothesis, the test fails.
*
* This is useful in checking whether a Monte Carlo method method converges
* against the right value. Because statistical tests are able to handle the
* inherent noise of these methods, they can be used to construct statistical
* test suites not unlike the traditional unit tests used in software engineering.
*
* This implementation can be used to test two things:
*
* 1. that the illumination scattered by a BRDF model under uniform illumination
*    into a certain direction matches a given value (modulo noise).
*
* 2. that the average radiance received by a camera within some scene
*    matches a given value (modulo noise).
